This package serve the following purpose: 
* Provide minimum bundle size by including styles that are used.
* Wide range of components styles and effects are provided that are not present in single UI library,
* No naming conflict for styles, user can change the name of the classes as needed.
* Full documentation with highly customizable components.
* Easy integration to Javascript libraries (only react is supported for now).







# My notes to remember things before publish

npm will ignore the `.gitignore` file if `.npmignore` is present, So make sure files should not get included in package if they are not suppose to.


* Add build process, read from other sass libraries.
* Add typescript support.
